Ben Eater's 6502 Computer C Implementation

In order to build this, first make a `bin` folder and place all the executable files necessary for vbcc cross compilation (`vasm6502_oldstyle`, `vbcc6502`, `vc`, `vlink`). You can download them here: http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html in the "6502 related Download/link area" section Then you can run the `buildall.sh` script to build both the startup code and the `src/hello.c` as well.
